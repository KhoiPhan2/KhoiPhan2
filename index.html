            <h2>Micron, selling the high bandwidth memory shovel for the AI gold rush</h2>
            <p>1/29/2025</p>
            <p>As this is my first blog post lets first catch you guys up on my current stock ideas. I currently hold micron which I believe will stand to benefit in the next two years.</p>
            <p>Micron sells DRAM/NAND and generally memory to other businesses similarly to other household names such as samsung and sk hynix. Now, to be honest this memory isn't anything  </p>
            <p>I care about too much because generally memory is considered an commodity as opposed to other semiconductor products. This is because basically memory is interchangeable from company to company.</p>
            <p>Now why am I bringing all this bad news up when I think the company will do well? High bandwidth memory is different. Micron is currently dominating this field, outcompeting its competitors in Nvidia's latest chips. High bandwidth memory is used in  </p>
            <p>AMD and Nvidia's GPUs that are used to train AI. Some other things to note, with the coming tariffs on outside chips coming from the administration, micron positions itself as the largest HBM </p>
            <p>manufacturer in the USA. They additionally also won a ton of money from the CHIPS act which will only increase their productions and hold on the HBM market. DeepSeek also just plunged the market</p>
            <p>so the time is good to buy, as I believe it is trading at a discount.</p>
            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <p>Some more additional financial metrics that are of note to me.</p>
            <p>PE Ratio (FWD) : 14.31 statistically lower than most S&P 500 tech companies at the moment. Means discount/Undervalued! </p>
            <p>In 2028, Micron expects HBM total addressable market (TAM) to grow four times from the $16 billion level in 2024 and to exceed $100 billion by 2030. They're also already sold out for the next two years. </p>
            <p>Data center revenue grew over 400% year over year, stargate will increase this most likely and tech continues to expand their datacenters</p>
            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <p>My position</p>
